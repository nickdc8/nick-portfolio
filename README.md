# Personal Design and Frontend Developer Website

![Project Preview](https://github.com/nickdc8/nick-portfolio/blob/main/readme-image.png)

 This website showcases both my design work and frontend development projects. It was built using Next.js and powered by the Contentful CMS, making it a dynamic and interactive platform to share my work.
